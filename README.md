# calculator
My first attempt to do somethng more complex then school programm 
Takes expression from input and parse it symbol by symbol
Callculate from left to right without priorities 
To do: Redesig it so it reads and parse expression first, performs evaluation operations in proper order and understands ^x and brackets.
